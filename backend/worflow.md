1. Create the models for our database with Sequelize

2. As we create our models we also want to add any constraints / validations / associations that we can think of

3. Create our seeders for each table/model (check sqlite3 database after seeding to make sure data looks correct)

4. Identify what routes are needed and implement them into our api directory

5. Begin working on all of our routes in the API docs starting from top to bottom
